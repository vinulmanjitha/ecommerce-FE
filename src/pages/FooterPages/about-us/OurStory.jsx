        In the early days of 2020, a small group of tech enthusiasts set out to change how people shop online. What started as a passion project in a tiny garage has evolved into a thriving eCommerce platform serving thousands of customers across the country.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Our goal was clear: make technology accessible, affordable, and enjoyable for everyone. With a customer-first mindset, we built a platform that prioritizes simplicity, reliability, and transparency.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Along the way, we faced our fair share of challenges—from inventory shortages to logistic hurdles—but each obstacle only strengthened our resolve. Our dedicated team of developers, designers, and support staff poured their heart into building something meaningful.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Today, we are proud of our journey, and we're just getting started. Our story is one of persistence, growth, and community—and you’re a part of it. Thank you for believing in us.
